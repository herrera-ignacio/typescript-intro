# TypeScript Introduction

## What's TypeScript

* Open-source __typed, syntatic superset__ of JavaScript, developed by Microsoft.
* Compiles to __redeable JavaScript__.
* Comes in three parts: __Language__, __Language Server__ and __Compiler__.
* Works seamlessly with __Babel 7__.

## Why

* Encode __constraints and assumptions__ as part of __developer intent__.
* __Catch common mistakes__.
* Move some __runtime errors to compile time__.
* Provide your consumers (including yourself) with a __great DX__ (Developer Experience).

## Fundamentals

* __Adding type information__ to variables, functions and classes.
* Configuring the compiler.
* Practical strategy for incrementally __converting JS to TS__.
* __Parameterizing interfaces and type aliases__ with generics.
* Conditional, mapped and branded types.
* TS Compiler API basics.
